# This list constraint defines the set of Shared VPC host projects that
# projects at or below this resource can attach to. By default, a project can
# attach to any host project in the same organization, thereby becoming a
# service project. Projects, folders, and organizations in allowed/denied
# lists affect all objects underneath them in the resource hierarchy, and must
# be specified in the form: under:organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID,
# under:folders/FOLDER_ID, or projects/PROJECT_ID.
